## Overview

The **Simple Personal Finance API** is a serverless application that helps users manage their finances with ease. The API allows users to track expenses, monitor account balances, and receive basic financial insights.

Built using modern serverless technologies, this API demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and secure scalable backend services using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. It focuses on delivering simplicity while showcasing the core skills essential for backend development, including authentication, API design, and serverless architecture.

## Features

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **Account Management**: Add, update, and delete financial accounts.
- **Expense Tracking**: Log and manage expenses with specific categories (e.g., "Food", "Rent").
- **Budget Overview**: Set and monitor a monthly budget.
- **Financial Insights**: Get a breakdown of spending habits, including top categories and total monthly expenses.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js
- **API Management**: AWS API Gateway
- **Serverless Execution**: AWS Lambda
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Serverless Framework
- **Development Tools**: Serverless Offline for local testing, Postman for API testing

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-finance-api.git
